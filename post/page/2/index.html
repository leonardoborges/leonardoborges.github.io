      I&rsquo;ve been learning Scala for my current client project and I find writing to be a great tool to test my understanding of any given topic. This means there might be a few Scala posts coming up soon as I keep learning interesting things.
Today I&rsquo;ll be exploring a few different ways in which you can compose programs. I&rsquo;ll be using Scalaz in this post.
The examples that follow all deal with Vehicles - more specifically makes and parts:

      I released bouncer in April last year and since then it has had a small but steady growth in usage.
So much so that I received some community feedback in the form of emails and pull requests which is simply great!
The latest and most substantial pull request, submitted by Vadim Platonov, added the ability to customise validation messages in anyway you like, as you can see in the section Internationalization and customised error messages of the README.

      I finally got some free time so sit down and write this post. I was travelling with my girlfriend around the state of Victoria, Australia - mostly around the Great Ocean Road. I had an amazing time and it&rsquo;s a trip I highly recommend anyone do.

  Recently I had some free time to come back to Purely Functional Data Structures and implement a new data structure: Red-black trees.
Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.

      Long gone are the days when systems needed to do only one thing at a time.
Concurrency is the word but it often leads to complex code, dealing with locks, mutexes etc…
There are several different abstractions which allows us to both model and think about asynchronous code in a more sane fashion: futures, promises and events/callbacks are but a few of them.
I won&rsquo;t get into the merits - or lack thereof - of these alternatives in this post but rather focus on a different alternative: Communicating Sequential Processes - CSP.

      I hinted at LambdaJam Australia back in my 2012 Highlights post and the dates are fast approaching so I thought appropriate to blog about it once more.
YOW! LambdaJam is a conference targeted at intermediate and advanced functional programmers and is organised in talks, jams and workshops.
 Talks are the traditional format and are 30 minutes long; Workshops aim to introduce a specific subjects to attendees in great detail and are up to two hours long; Jams are hands-on sessions.

      Last week while attending Clojure/West in Portland I came across a paper called Why calculating is better than scheming. In a nutshell, this paper is a critique to Abelson and Sussman&lsquo;s classic textbook SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, used by MIT for many years to teach their introductory programming course.
If you haven&rsquo;t read SICP, you should. It&rsquo;s an amazing book. It uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, as the vehicle to present fundamental programming concepts.

  Last year I started reading a book called Purely Functional Data Structures. It&rsquo;s a fascinating book and if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how Clojure&rsquo;s persistent data structures work, it&rsquo;s mandatory reading.
However, all code samples in the book are written in ML - with Haskell versions in the end of the book.

      Today I&rsquo;m releasing bouncer, which was extracted from a project I&rsquo;ve been working on.
It&rsquo;s a validation library for Clojure apps and it lets you write code like this:
(def person {:name &#34;Leo&#34;}) (validate person :name required :age [required number]) If you&rsquo;d like to see more examples and a detailed guide check out the github repository. The README should get you started.
This post however isn&rsquo;t only about announcing bouncer. It&rsquo;s also about the motivation and implementation details behind it.
