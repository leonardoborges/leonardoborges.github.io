      I solved a few of the problems on Project Euler in the past, both in Java and Ruby, and thought it would be useful to redo them in Clojure, thus improving my skills on the language&rsquo;s core functions and libraries. Today I&rsquo;ll share problem 4.
Go ahead and read it but here&rsquo;s the meat of it:
&ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.

      As I promised in my previous post, here are the highlights of what Ola Bini had to say about Clojure/conj.
Clojure/conj is the largest gathering of clojure programmers, hackers and enthusiasts, with a single track of talks spanning three days. Ola selected his favorite talks and summarised each one of them.
The actual slides for each one of the talks can be found on github.
You can find Ola&rsquo;s slides here.

      Update: We now have a [Meetup.com page][9]. Head over there to learn about our next meetups as well as to RSVP to them. We&rsquo;ll discontinue usage of the wiki for registering attendees, in favor of the new site. Everything else on this post however still holds.
If you&rsquo;ve been following my blog, you&rsquo;ll have noticed I started running internal Clojure meetups/hack nights at ThoughtWorks here in Sydney a while ago. While being closed, we&rsquo;ve already had one international speaker - [Ola Bini][7] - come and share his experience as an attendee at [Clojure/conj][8].

      It&rsquo;s that time of the year to look back at what you&rsquo;ve done and either be happy about it or&hellip; well not. :)
To me anyway 2011 was a great year but I won&rsquo;t bore you with the details so I&rsquo;ll just jump straight into a couple of highlights!
The biggest one of course was the project we developed to help the Queensland flood victims back in January - which brings me to the next topic:

      A year ago I decided to try my hand on iPhone software development and created a very simple application to experience the whole lifecycle of putting a complete project on the Apple AppStore - I wrote about it a while back.
The result was RottingNames, a heavy metal band name generator.
Since then, I haven&rsquo;t developed anything else for the iPhone - mostly because my interest lies elsewhere now - but I did notice a small yet steady amount of downloads for this cool little app.

I was in SÃ£o Paulo last week - the 3rd and 4th of November - for RubyConf Brazil. For those who don&rsquo;t know, RubyConf Brazil is the evolution of Rails Summit Latin America, where I had the privilege to speak in 2009.
This year though, all bets were off. Fabio Akita and Locaweb put together a great event, with over 700 attendees and about 30 speakers split in two streams and two awesome days.

      So I had just finished writing this feature. I was confident it&rsquo;d work - after all I had a good level of tests around it. It sounded like yet another successful deployment.
One week in and something starts breaking. It was hard to track down but at the end I realised it was caused by having concurrent processes running in parallel.
That&rsquo;s what happened in a recent production release at our current client.

That&rsquo;s why I decided to post them here so I know where to look in the future. And of course they can turn out to be useful to someone else too.
So without further ado, here they are:
