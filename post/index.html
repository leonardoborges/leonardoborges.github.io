      Early last week I had the chance to attend the Symposium on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology organised by UNSW. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that UNSW was so heavily involved in the community until this event and have since learned about their interest group which has been going on for a while.
The talks had a healthy mix of research and industry case studies with subjects ranging from the technical challenges of current blockchain implementations to the legal implications of distributed ledger technology.

      If you haven&rsquo;t yet, make sure you read my summary of Day 1 first.
Morning Panel Day 2 started with a morning panel with:
 Paul Fox from Blockchain.capital Leon Gerard Vandenberg from RightsFusion Pty Ltd &amp; Solara Oliver Harvey from ASIC Ross Buckley from UNSW Law  The panelists took turns in giving their views around blockchain, investments and regulation, leading into a Q&amp;A at the end. I was running late to this session and believe I may have missed Ross&rsquo; individual slot.

      A year and four months ago I joined Atlassian to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at EuroClojure and this year at QCon Brazil. Even Cognitect wrote a few words about it.
In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many!

      In the beginning Nearly 4 years ago I founded the Sydney Clojure User Group. I had been playing with Clojure for a little while and started a small study group to learn more. Initially this group was private and held at the ThoughtWorks office.
After a couple of meetups and conversations I decided to open up the group to the public and then realised we weren&rsquo;t the only ones interested in Clojure and, even more important, interested in meeting like-minded people, share experiences and help each other.

      I should have published this post still in 2015 but as I was on holidays traveling around Australia I didn&rsquo;t really have the time to do it. Better late than never, right? (also Linode - the provider hosting this site - has been under a severe DDoS attack so the site just came back up today)
2015 has been a unusually quiet year in this blog. Thankfully that is because I have been extremely busy in many other areas.

      I&rsquo;m extremely happy to let everyone know my book, Clojure Reactive Programming, has finally been published!
You can get it at the publisher&rsquo;s website or on Amazon. I had a great time writing it and I truly hope you find it useful!
I&rsquo;ve met a few authors here and there and I heard more than once that a book is never really finished. I now know what they mean.
The book doesn&rsquo;t cover everything I wanted to write about due to time and space limitations.

      Another year is about to end and as it is tradition in this blog it&rsquo;s time to look at the year&rsquo;s highlights!
Functional Programming I have been advocating Functional Programming and Clojure for a while now and 2014 has been good to me. It was the first year where I was paid to work almost entirely in functional languages. Most of it was in Scala and a little less in Clojure.

      Thanks, ThoughtWorks After 4 years and 8 months I have made the hard decision to change jobs: Friday, 19th of December, was my last day at ThoughtWorks.
In this time I have made many friends and have grown a lot as a professional. Consulting presents so many new challenges that often times the technical problems you are trying to solve are the easiest part of the whole project. I am thankful for that.

      This past weekend - 19-20th of December - a group of highly motivated individuals gave up their Friday night and their entire Saturday simply to learn how to code in Clojure!
It was the first ever ClojureBridge edition in Sydney and if you haven&rsquo;t heard of it before, its goal is to increase diversity in the Clojure community. It does so by offering free workshops targeted at beginners.
You should totally read Julian Gamble&rsquo;s post about the event for details.

      A bit late for a EuroClojure 2014 post but I suppose &ldquo;better late than never&rdquo; applies here.
The best part of every conference is the networking. Meeting new and interesting people is priceless and I did plenty of that - mostly over Polish beer and food. Polish beer isn&rsquo;t the greatest but if you must have it, better stick to Żywiec. It&rsquo;s widely available and was the one which didn&rsquo;t give me a headache :) - I&rsquo;ve been told there are amazing microbreweries though I didn&rsquo;t get a chance to try any while in Krákow.
