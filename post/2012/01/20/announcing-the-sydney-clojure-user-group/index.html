<p><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2011/10/12/report-clojure-meetup-1/">If you&rsquo;ve been following my blog</a>, you&rsquo;ll have noticed I started running internal Clojure meetups/hack nights at ThoughtWorks here in Sydney a while ago. While being closed, we&rsquo;ve already had one international speaker - [Ola Bini][7] - come and share his experience as an attendee at [Clojure/conj][8]. I promise I&rsquo;ll blog about it soon.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re a small but active group, eager to learn and as a natural result we couldn&rsquo;t stay closed for any longer! :)</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why last Tuesday, the first time we had external guests, we decided to make the group public so anyone could join.</p>
<p>It was great having people from outside ThoughtWorks sharing their real world experience with Clojure. One of them, Harry Binnendijk from <a href="http://www.whoto.com/">Whoto</a>, even gave a presentation about how and why they&rsquo;re using Clojure <em>[1]</em>.</p>
<p>There was another talk, by yours truly, on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/borgesleonardo/continuation-passing-style-and-macros-in-clojure-jan-2012">Continuation Passing Style and Macros in Clojure</a>. It was a great night.</p>
<p>Interested? Read on.</p>
<p>Our meetings will be held on the 3rd Tuesday of every month - at least to start with.</p>
<p>To help organize things we have a [Google group][5] where we&rsquo;ll announce the next meetings, do the traditional &ldquo;call for papers&rdquo;, share ideas on how to improve our group, job posts and anything related to Clojure/FP.</p>
<p>We also have a [wiki][6] where you can see when and where the meetings are happening, sign up to talk/attend etc&hellip;</p>
<p>So if you&rsquo;ve been thinking about learning Clojure but haven&rsquo;t had the chance yet, [come join us][5]. Joining a group like this in its beginning is a perfect learning opportunity.</p>
<p>And if you&rsquo;re a Clojure hacker already, [we&rsquo;d love to hear from you just as much][5]!</p>
<p>We welcome all levels and encourage everyone to submit talks they&rsquo;re passionate about.</p>
<p>I hope to see you in the next meet up. Feel free to shoot the group an email or to me directly at leonardoborges(dot)rj(at)gmail(dot)com</p>
<p>And don&rsquo;t forget to add us to your calendar so you don&rsquo;t miss out - next meetup will be on Feb 21st at ThoughtWorks Sydney!</p>
