<h2 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h2>
<p>I have been advocating Functional Programming and Clojure for a while now and 2014 has been good to me. It was the first year where I was paid to work almost entirely in functional languages. Most of it was in Scala and a little less in Clojure.</p>
<p>I did have a short 8-week gig in Javascript but even then I tried to make it as functional as possible - e.g.: making use of Reactive Programming techniques (<a href="http://reactivex.io/">Rx-style</a>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also thankful for the opportunity to have organised the first Sydney edition of <a href="http://www.clojurebridge.org/">ClojureBridge</a>, a workshop aimed at increasing diversity in the Clojure community by delivering free workshops for women. You can read more about what we did on the day <a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/12/22/clojurebridge-sydney/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Another bit of exciting news is that I&rsquo;ve decided to quit <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a>. Starting in January I&rsquo;ll be doing Clojure full-time at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a>. I&rsquo;ve written about it <a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/12/27/staring-a-new-chapter/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to a very functional year!</p>
<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
<p>Early this year I was invited by <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> to write a book on Reactive Programming in Clojure. I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/07/20/euroclojure-2014-and-clojure-reactive-programming/">announced it before in this blog</a> but it is definitely a highlight of this year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/CljReactiveProg">book</a> has been a while in the making and I had no idea of the amount of effort involved in writing one. I&rsquo;m mostly content-complete now but working through a number of useful bits of feedback I got from early reviewers. I expect to be done with these in January and then the book should go into production.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep everybody posted :)</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Most of what I read this year - with the little free time I had - were academic papers and I would like to highlight a few that I particularly enjoyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf">Monads for functional programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/propositions-as-types/propositions-as-types.pdf">Propositions as Types</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~dreyer/course/papers/wadler.pdf">Theorems for free!</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~byorgey/pub/monoid-pearl.pdf">Monoids: Theme and Variations (Functional Pearl)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conal.net/papers/icfp97/icfp97.pdf">Functional Reactive Animation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://conal.net/papers/push-pull-frp/push-pull-frp.pdf">Push-pull Functional Reactive Programming</a></li>
<li><a href="http://elm-lang.org/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf">Elm: Concurrent FRP for Functional GUIs</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally I can&rsquo;t help myself and recommend that you read <a href="http://www.manning.com/bjarnason/">Functional Programming in Scala</a> if you have any interest in FP and  Scala. <a href="https://twitter.com/runarorama">Rúnar</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/pchiusano">Paul</a> have done a great job and put a lot of good advice in this book.</p>
<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>
<p>Between work and writing the book I&rsquo;m happy I managed to speak this much:</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the Top 5 posts from this blog in 2014:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/06/17/functional-composition-with-monads-kleisli-functors/">Functional Composition With Monads, Kleislis and Functors</a> - With learning Scala and Scalaz, I&rsquo;ve come to learn new ways of composing programs. This short post is a brief look on one of them, Kleisli arrows.</p>

<li>
<p><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2012/11/30/monads-in-small-bites-part-i-functors/">Monads in Small Bites - Part I - Functors</a> - I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised this post ranked this high. It&rsquo;s from a series about Monads and I&rsquo;m glad it has been helping people understand the general idea behind them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/03/25/clojure-and-why-calculating-is-better-than-scheming/">Clojure and &lsquo;Why Calculating Is Better Than Scheming&rsquo;</a> - A fresh look at this popular paper by <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/">Philip Wadler</a> from a Clojure perspective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2013/07/06/clojure-core-dot-async-lisp-advantage/">Clojure, core.async and the Lisp Advantage</a> - <a href="https://github.com/clojure/core.async">core.async</a> is still all the rage in the Clojure community and this post from 2013 gives a brief introduction as to what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>

<p>If this tells me anything it&rsquo;s that I need to blog more!</p>
