      <description>Early last week I had the chance to attend the Symposium on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology organised by UNSW. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware that UNSW was so heavily involved in the community until this event and have since learned about their interest group which has been going on for a while.
The talks had a healthy mix of research and industry case studies with subjects ranging from the technical challenges of current blockchain implementations to the legal implications of distributed ledger technology.</description>

      <description>If you haven&amp;rsquo;t yet, make sure you read my summary of Day 1 first.
Morning Panel Day 2 started with a morning panel with:
 Paul Fox from Blockchain.capital Leon Gerard Vandenberg from RightsFusion Pty Ltd &amp;amp; Solara Oliver Harvey from ASIC Ross Buckley from UNSW Law  The panelists took turns in giving their views around blockchain, investments and regulation, leading into a Q&amp;amp;A at the end. I was running late to this session and believe I may have missed Ross&amp;rsquo; individual slot.</description>

      <description>A year and four months ago I joined Atlassian to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at EuroClojure and this year at QCon Brazil. Even Cognitect wrote a few words about it.
In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many!</description>

      <description>In the beginning Nearly 4 years ago I founded the Sydney Clojure User Group. I had been playing with Clojure for a little while and started a small study group to learn more. Initially this group was private and held at the ThoughtWorks office.
After a couple of meetups and conversations I decided to open up the group to the public and then realised we weren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones interested in Clojure and, even more important, interested in meeting like-minded people, share experiences and help each other.</description>

      <description>I should have published this post still in 2015 but as I was on holidays traveling around Australia I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have the time to do it. Better late than never, right? (also Linode - the provider hosting this site - has been under a severe DDoS attack so the site just came back up today)
2015 has been a unusually quiet year in this blog. Thankfully that is because I have been extremely busy in many other areas.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy to let everyone know my book, Clojure Reactive Programming, has finally been published!
You can get it at the publisher&amp;rsquo;s website or on Amazon. I had a great time writing it and I truly hope you find it useful!
I&amp;rsquo;ve met a few authors here and there and I heard more than once that a book is never really finished. I now know what they mean.
The book doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything I wanted to write about due to time and space limitations.</description>

      <description>Another year is about to end and as it is tradition in this blog it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the year&amp;rsquo;s highlights!
Functional Programming I have been advocating Functional Programming and Clojure for a while now and 2014 has been good to me. It was the first year where I was paid to work almost entirely in functional languages. Most of it was in Scala and a little less in Clojure.</description>

      <description>Thanks, ThoughtWorks After 4 years and 8 months I have made the hard decision to change jobs: Friday, 19th of December, was my last day at ThoughtWorks.
In this time I have made many friends and have grown a lot as a professional. Consulting presents so many new challenges that often times the technical problems you are trying to solve are the easiest part of the whole project. I am thankful for that.</description>

      <description>This past weekend - 19-20th of December - a group of highly motivated individuals gave up their Friday night and their entire Saturday simply to learn how to code in Clojure!
It was the first ever ClojureBridge edition in Sydney and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it before, its goal is to increase diversity in the Clojure community. It does so by offering free workshops targeted at beginners.
You should totally read Julian Gamble&amp;rsquo;s post about the event for details.</description>

      <description>A bit late for a EuroClojure 2014 post but I suppose &amp;ldquo;better late than never&amp;rdquo; applies here.
The best part of every conference is the networking. Meeting new and interesting people is priceless and I did plenty of that - mostly over Polish beer and food. Polish beer isn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest but if you must have it, better stick to Żywiec. It&amp;rsquo;s widely available and was the one which didn&amp;rsquo;t give me a headache :) - I&amp;rsquo;ve been told there are amazing microbreweries though I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to try any while in Krákow.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning Scala for my current client project and I find writing to be a great tool to test my understanding of any given topic. This means there might be a few Scala posts coming up soon as I keep learning interesting things.
Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be exploring a few different ways in which you can compose programs. I&amp;rsquo;ll be using Scalaz in this post.
The examples that follow all deal with Vehicles - more specifically makes and parts:</description>

      <description>I released bouncer in April last year and since then it has had a small but steady growth in usage.
So much so that I received some community feedback in the form of emails and pull requests which is simply great!
The latest and most substantial pull request, submitted by Vadim Platonov, added the ability to customise validation messages in anyway you like, as you can see in the section Internationalization and customised error messages of the README.</description>

      <description>I finally got some free time so sit down and write this post. I was travelling with my girlfriend around the state of Victoria, Australia - mostly around the Great Ocean Road. I had an amazing time and it&amp;rsquo;s a trip I highly recommend anyone do.
As for this year&amp;rsquo;s highlights, let&amp;rsquo;s get started:
Clojure clj-syd - the Sydney Clojure User Group - continues going strong and this is in great part thanks to the amazing community behind it.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sitting in the Lobby of the Hilton in Boston and since my flight back to Australia isn&amp;rsquo;t for a few hours I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write my experience report while everything is still fresh in my mind.
  CUFP - Commercial Users of Functional Programming - is a Workshop-like conference targeting the practically-minded functional programming community.
As it&amp;rsquo;s stated on their website, &amp;ldquo;The CUFP workshop is a place where people can see how others are using functional programming to solve real world problems […]&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>This post is part of a series about Chris Okasaki&amp;rsquo;s Purely Functional Data Structures. You can see all posts in the series by visiting the functional-data-structures category in this blog.
  Recently I had some free time to come back to Purely Functional Data Structures and implement a new data structure: Red-black trees.
Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.</description>

      <description>Long gone are the days when systems needed to do only one thing at a time.
Concurrency is the word but it often leads to complex code, dealing with locks, mutexes etc…
There are several different abstractions which allows us to both model and think about asynchronous code in a more sane fashion: futures, promises and events/callbacks are but a few of them.
I won&amp;rsquo;t get into the merits - or lack thereof - of these alternatives in this post but rather focus on a different alternative: Communicating Sequential Processes - CSP.</description>

      <description>I hinted at LambdaJam Australia back in my 2012 Highlights post and the dates are fast approaching so I thought appropriate to blog about it once more.
YOW! LambdaJam is a conference targeted at intermediate and advanced functional programmers and is organised in talks, jams and workshops.
 Talks are the traditional format and are 30 minutes long; Workshops aim to introduce a specific subjects to attendees in great detail and are up to two hours long; Jams are hands-on sessions.</description>

      <description>Last week while attending Clojure/West in Portland I came across a paper called Why calculating is better than scheming. In a nutshell, this paper is a critique to Abelson and Sussman&amp;lsquo;s classic textbook SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, used by MIT for many years to teach their introductory programming course.
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read SICP, you should. It&amp;rsquo;s an amazing book. It uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, as the vehicle to present fundamental programming concepts.</description>

  Last year I started reading a book called Purely Functional Data Structures. It&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating book and if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever wondered how Clojure&amp;rsquo;s persistent data structures work, it&amp;rsquo;s mandatory reading.
However, all code samples in the book are written in ML - with Haskell versions in the end of the book.</description>

      <description>Today I&amp;rsquo;m releasing bouncer, which was extracted from a project I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
It&amp;rsquo;s a validation library for Clojure apps and it lets you write code like this:
(def person {:name &amp;#34;Leo&amp;#34;}) (validate person :name required :age [required number]) If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see more examples and a detailed guide check out the github repository. The README should get you started.
This post however isn&amp;rsquo;t only about announcing bouncer. It&amp;rsquo;s also about the motivation and implementation details behind it.</description>

      <description>Keeping the tradition of end-of-year blog posts, here are my year highlights for 2012:
Clojure I started clj-syd - the Sydney Clojure User Group - back in January and it has seen a major uptake. We consistently get an average of 25 people each month and there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of talks and topics to discuss. It&amp;rsquo;s a great crowd and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have started it and of being part of it.</description>

  Part I - Functors
  Part II - Applicative Functors
  Part III - Monoids
  Part IV - Monads (this post)
  A quick recap In Part I we learned about Functors, which are things that can be mapped over using a normal function - fmap is used for that.</description>

  Part I - Functors
  Part II - Applicative Functors
  Part III - Monoids (this post)
  Part IV - Monads
  Monoids Simply put, Monoids describe types containing a binary function and an identity value.
When applied to the identity value and a random value x, said function leaves its argument x untouched, returning it as a result.</description>

      <description>Today I join the already bloated group of people who wrote monad tutorials. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a ritual, really.
Different than most tutorials though I aim to take a different approach. The good news is that I won&amp;rsquo;t be comparing monads to burritos :)
People say one needs to have his/her own epiphany in order to understand Monads and reading explanations from others is of little help. My goal is to disprove that.</description>

      <description>Last week our current client - ninemsn - ran the 3rd edition of their HackDay.
It&amp;rsquo;s akin to Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s ShipIt days so if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the concept, you should check their page but here&amp;rsquo;s the gist:
  We&amp;rsquo;re given 24 hours to work on whatever we like as long as it&amp;rsquo;s related somehow to the business
  We&amp;rsquo;re also free to use any technology we want</description>

      <title>Clojure, leiningen 2 and Heroku: AOT compilation gotchas</title>

      <description>Recently I upgraded the clojure project I&amp;rsquo;m working on to Leiningen 2 in order to start using nrepl - since swank-clojure is now deprecated. Little did I know this would lead me to a small debugging adventure.
Heroku I use Heroku as my deployment platform and my project had been running on it for a few weeks without any issues. I also use Heroku&amp;rsquo;s PostgreSQL solution.
However, by upgrading to Leiningen 2, my project started throwing some weird exceptions during deployment - it couldn&amp;rsquo;t connect to my database any longer.</description>

      <title>Sean Corfield: Clojure and CFML sitting in a tree</title>

      <description>Last night I attended the Adobe User Group here in Sydney. That might strike some of you as a big surprise given my relationship with Adobe is pretty much limited to fiddling with Photoshop/Lightroom to get my photos looking nice.
However the reason for which I attended the meetup is that Sean Corfield - a prolific member of the Clojure community - gave a presentation on how he introduced and migrated most of his backend code at World Singles from CFML to Clojure - hence my interest.</description>

      <description>UPDATE: As pointed to me in this commment, sym links aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary for Waxsim anymore. Check Jonathan Penn&amp;rsquo;s fork on github.
 After coming back from my holidays in China - which were awesome - I had no downtime at ThoughtWorks and started at a brand new client/project - a much needed change from what I had been working on lately.
It&amp;rsquo;s an iOS project, more specifically an iPad app and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all I can tell you about it.</description>

      <description>Last night we held the first ever meetup for the Sydney Clojure User Group!
When I decided to start running the meetups I had no idea we&amp;rsquo;d end up with 37 people on the first night! What a great turn out!
As for the content, here&amp;rsquo;s what you missed:
 Running Clojure apps on Heroku - Lincoln Stoll (@lstoll)  Linc works for Heroku but ended up not spending a whole lot of time talking about that - instead he showed us how to build a simple web application using Compojure, a small Clojure web framework.</description>

      <title>project euler problem 4 in clojure</title>
      <link>http://leonardoborges.com/writings/2012/02/05/project-euler-problem-4-in-clojure/</link>

      <description>I solved a few of the problems on Project Euler in the past, both in Java and Ruby, and thought it would be useful to redo them in Clojure, thus improving my skills on the language&amp;rsquo;s core functions and libraries. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll share problem 4.
Go ahead and read it but here&amp;rsquo;s the meat of it:
&amp;ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&amp;quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&amp;rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.</description>

      <description>As I promised in my previous post, here are the highlights of what Ola Bini had to say about Clojure/conj.
Clojure/conj is the largest gathering of clojure programmers, hackers and enthusiasts, with a single track of talks spanning three days. Ola selected his favorite talks and summarised each one of them.
The actual slides for each one of the talks can be found on github.
You can find Ola&amp;rsquo;s slides here.</description>

      <description>Update: We now have a [Meetup.com page][9]. Head over there to learn about our next meetups as well as to RSVP to them. We&amp;rsquo;ll discontinue usage of the wiki for registering attendees, in favor of the new site. Everything else on this post however still holds.
If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following my blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll have noticed I started running internal Clojure meetups/hack nights at ThoughtWorks here in Sydney a while ago. While being closed, we&amp;rsquo;ve already had one international speaker - [Ola Bini][7] - come and share his experience as an attendee at [Clojure/conj][8].</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year to look back at what you&amp;rsquo;ve done and either be happy about it or&amp;hellip; well not. :)
To me anyway 2011 was a great year but I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with the details so I&amp;rsquo;ll just jump straight into a couple of highlights!
The biggest one of course was the project we developed to help the Queensland flood victims back in January - which brings me to the next topic:</description>

      <description>A year ago I decided to try my hand on iPhone software development and created a very simple application to experience the whole lifecycle of putting a complete project on the Apple AppStore - I wrote about it a while back.
The result was RottingNames, a heavy metal band name generator.
Since then, I haven&amp;rsquo;t developed anything else for the iPhone - mostly because my interest lies elsewhere now - but I did notice a small yet steady amount of downloads for this cool little app.</description>

      <description>I was in São Paulo last week - the 3rd and 4th of November - for RubyConf Brazil. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, RubyConf Brazil is the evolution of Rails Summit Latin America, where I had the privilege to speak in 2009.
This year though, all bets were off. Fabio Akita and Locaweb put together a great event, with over 700 attendees and about 30 speakers split in two streams and two awesome days.</description>

      <description>So I had just finished writing this feature. I was confident it&amp;rsquo;d work - after all I had a good level of tests around it. It sounded like yet another successful deployment.
One week in and something starts breaking. It was hard to track down but at the end I realised it was caused by having concurrent processes running in parallel.
That&amp;rsquo;s what happened in a recent production release at our current client.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working fulltime with Git for a while now and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a pattern of commands that emerge every so often, but not often enough that would make me remember them.
That&amp;rsquo;s why I decided to post them here so I know where to look in the future. And of course they can turn out to be useful to someone else too.
So without further ado, here they are:</description>
