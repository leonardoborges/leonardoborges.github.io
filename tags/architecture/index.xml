      <description>I said final classes are evil and that post got some attention with interesting comments. Maybe because of the title and the tone I wrote it, a few comments didn&#39;t get my real intention and perhaps I should have been more explicit about it. Go ahead and read it. I&#39;ll wait. :)
Anyway, I thought I&#39;d expand a little more on that subject, explaining my motivation to write that post and going through the topics I think were raised by my dear readers.</description>

      <description>Update: Go ahead and read this post in its entirety - including the comments. Then, read my other post where I expand the subject a little more. --
Every now and then I still do some Java coding. And I actually like it. I spent several years of my career developing primarily in Java and am very keen about the language.
I&#39;ve been a fierce defender of it these days, specially with the wave of popularity of other languages such as Ruby and Groovy.</description>

&lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html&#34;&gt;Dependency injection&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html&#34;&gt;DI&lt;/a&gt;Â - Â is a great thing. Really. The hability to tweak implementations without touching your code is awesome and the DI frameworks, like spring, saves you a lot of coding. No more service locators stuff.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, and there is always a but, you&#39;re left with a bunch of XML configuration. And I hate it. Not that XML files are bad... the thing is that everything nowadays has its own set of XML configurarion files. And &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.springframework.org&#34;&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt; is not different.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>scea 5 beta</title>

Hoje fiz a versÃ£o beta da nova prova de arquiteto da Sun e eis algumas impressÃµes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Ã‰ longa e cansativa... fato justificÃ¡vel se levar-mos em consideraÃ§Ã£o o fato de ser uma prova em estado beta. Ela possui mais questÃµes que a versÃ£o final. SÃ£o 153 questÃµes no total, em 4h e 30min.</description>

Nesse primeiro post vou falar um pouco sobre meu novo trabalho. Na verdade, sobre um problema que encontramos lÃ¡.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dentre diversas coisas que estamos fazendo, como migraÃ§Ãµes por exemplo, estou ajudando na elaboraÃ§Ã£o da arquitetura que irÃ¡ abrigar as novas aplicaÃ§Ãµes desenvolvidas na empresa.</description>
