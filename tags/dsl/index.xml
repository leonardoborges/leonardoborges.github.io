      <description>Today was the first day of the conference and it started with a tutorial about DSL&#39;s with Martin Fowler, Neal Ford and Rebecca Parsons. We also had as attendants Ola Bini, core developer of JRuby, and others. My expectations were pretty high and the presentation didn&#39;t let me down. I&#39;ll try to put here toghether my impressions and some notes I took while I was there.
Marting Fowler started discussing what DSL&#39;s are and giving some examples that many of us use in our day to day Job.</description>
