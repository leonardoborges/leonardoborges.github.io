      <description>Last week our current client - ninemsn - ran the 3rd edition of their HackDay.
It&amp;rsquo;s akin to Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s ShipIt days so if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with the concept, you should check their page but here&amp;rsquo;s the gist:
  We&amp;rsquo;re given 24 hours to work on whatever we like as long as it&amp;rsquo;s related somehow to the business
  We&amp;rsquo;re also free to use any technology we want</description>

      <description>UPDATE: As pointed to me in this commment, sym links aren&amp;rsquo;t necessary for Waxsim anymore. Check Jonathan Penn&amp;rsquo;s fork on github.
 After coming back from my holidays in China - which were awesome - I had no downtime at ThoughtWorks and started at a brand new client/project - a much needed change from what I had been working on lately.
It&amp;rsquo;s an iOS project, more specifically an iPad app and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much all I can tell you about it.</description>
