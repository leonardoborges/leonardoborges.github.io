      This is just another one of those boring weekends where I felt the need to hack on something.
If you follow Google Chrome's blog you're probably aware of this little nifty feature they started to implement in their latest builds: HTML5 voice recognition.
And that's when it struck me: "Hey, what if I use that and tweet with my voice instead of typing?"
The result of this hacking session is LoudParrot, a sample Rails app that shows how to do just that.

      Since I started working with Ruby about 4 years ago, I've used quite a few text editors and ide's: RadRails, gedit + plugins, TextMate and Vim.
TextMate is the one I've used the most and it's been ok for a long time. Until you realize you need half a dozen bundles to make it really useful for ruby development. Obviously the same goes for Vim and gedit.
Oh, and forget about refactoring.

       Last Tuesday I gave a short presentation on the whole Clouds Against the Floods thing at the Ruby on Rails Oceania User Group here in Sydney.
Those guys are awesome and they recorded the talk - thanks guys!
If you'd like to download the slides, they're available on Slideshare.
Enjoy! ;)

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      This is just a quick post to let you know that AppConstants can now be used as gem!
Just add it to your Gemfile and 'bundle install' it:
#in your Gemfile gem &quot;app_constants&quot; #in the console $ bundle install $ rails generate app_constants #then follow the instructions on-screen instructions 
It can also be used without Rails. Check out full instructions on the GitHub repository.
Feedback welcome :)

      I think by now everyone's heard of the hard time the guys up in Queensland, Australia are having because of the recent floods. People have lost their lives and many others have lost their homes and businesses, product of years of hard work.
As a result of this massive disaster the Queensland Government decided to run a telethon to encourage donations to help the flood victims. The Telethon aired last Sunday, 09/01/11, on Channel 9 and lasted for 2 hours.

In the meantime, this morning I got a feature request on github to allow AppConstants to interpret YAML files with embedded code like this:

I haven't needed it myself but thought it would be a nice addition so my latest commit does exactly that.

      Back in January I announced a small but useful plugin called AppConstants, that basically provides a central place where you can store environment specific constants. And since I started using Rails 3 in the past week, I thought I'd make it Rails 3 compatible.
The code is really simple and - as I expected - the upgrade process was quite straight forward.
I'm not gonna write a guide here on how to upgrade your plugins to Rails 3 - there is plenty about that around the web - but instead, just show the steps I went through to upgrade mine.

      Learning new programming languages is fun. And if it's your 2nd, 3rd...Nth programming language you will eventually look for features you already know and love.
Coming from Ruby - but after having done my fair amount of Java for many years, among other things - I end up looking for features like blocks, open classes and syntax sugar like automatic generation of attribute accessors. These are hard to let go of.

      What?
In Ruby you have basically two ways of defining private methods:

I see a small problem with both approaches. In the first one, and the most obvious, is that you need to duplicate the method name as well as add an extra method call - private - just to change its visibility.
The second approach avoids this but adds the risk of accidentally putting a method that is intended to be public under the private section of the source file, which can render an annoying debugging session.

Let's face it. We all write crappy code the 1st time. The difference is in what we do about it afterwards.
We might decide it's good enough and keep moving, or we could (and should!) stop and refactor it!

      Wanna help improve JRuby? Make sure you read this post by Charles Nutter first. There he explains how to run Ruby specs with JRuby.
Start with fixing Ruby specs is a great way to get acquainted with the code. And it&rsquo;s also a important task in order to make sure JRuby is the most complete and compatible ruby implementation out there.
But before you get your hands dirty, it will be a lot easier if you can actually debug JRuby&rsquo;s source while fixing any specs - or bugs/features for that matter.

      As you probably know, since rails 2.1 you can write test methods in the following format:
test "hotel should return its permalink" do
#your test code here
end

Which is great, as the test name becomes much more clear. But you can't simply run this test easily from the command line. You'd have to run something like:
$ ruby your_test_file.rb -n test_hotel_should_return_its_permalink

It annoys me. And it's not practical either to make the test fail just so you can get the test's real name.

      There are several ways you can measure your rails application's performance. The techniques range from filling your code with "puts" statements - :p - to fancy ones like NewRelic - which is quite nice, I must say.
But what many people don't know is that rails ships with a handful of scripts to help you out. One of which is called profiler, located under your application's scripts/performance directory.
By default it uses the standard ruby profiler but if you want more speed - and additional reporting options - , consider installing the ruby-prof gem.

      So you found yourself in the need to override a method but still count on it's old behaviour?
No problem! Override it with your new code, call super and.... Uh oh!! Suddenly this turned into a problem... Let me give some more context.
I was testing Ferret (and the acts_as_ferret plugin) in a project to provide full text search capabilities to our models. One of the things the plugin does is to add a new method to ActiveRecord, called find_with_ferret.

This year we will have the Rails Summit Latin America on October, 15th and 16th, in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
It's by far the biggest Rails event we've ever had, including many of the speakers that were present at RailsConf.
FÃ¡bio Akita is also one of the speakers and provides more details on his blog.
If you're a assumed rails geek don't miss the opportunity to hear from the big names and to know a beautiful country like Brazil.

      This week we started to test mod_rails in a couple of projects where I work on. One in production.
Of course it's too early for any conclusions, but I just wanted to share a couple of problems you might find when the installer tries to compile the Apache module.
In our case, and I believe it is the case of many servers out there, we have a custom Apache installation, what makes the installer not find it and/or not find the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) sometimes.

I arrived last week in Madrid and the past 2 weeks before that I spent basically packing my stuff. There is still some paperwork going on but everything is flowing well.
Besides this little feedback, I was reading this week's issue of the excellent series This Week In Ruby, from my friend Antonio Cangiano.

The idea is to ease the pain on rails applications deployment. I tested myself and in less than five minutes I had my application working behind Apache!
I'm not going to say much here besides the fact that it seems like a really good option for rails deployment and people have been talking about it already, including DHH.
But I do recommend a read on the architecture overview document.

As I told in my last post, it was time to give JRuby a serious try. So I took one of our rails projects at work and decided to migrate it to JRuby and see what happens.
We heavily use the XML capabilities of DB2 and this was a huge problem. Every query would work just fine through the activerecord-jdbc-adapter - part of the JRuby Extras .

      This is quite funny. A friend, Perl addicted, is now learning Ruby. He really enjoys the language but made a interesting observation: Ruby is a language for lazy programmers!
Well, I have to agree... You know, I love saving keystrokes and achieving more by writing less. And this is so true with Ruby.
Let me give a really simple example, comparing with java - don't get me wrong... I love java, specially the platform, but it fits well here since I've always been a Java guy.

We are investing high in Ruby on Rails and we have now a few internal applications in development stages. Our manager wanted the ability to let people log in to our rails applications(for now) using their OpenID accounts.
It was a funny task, as I knew very little about OpenID.

Well, we all know how hard, or at least cumbersome, it can be to set up a production environment to deploy your applications. Besides all the hardware stuff like storages, links, routers you are still left with a huge amount of software configuration to handle. This often includes configuring things like clusters, load balancing and services monitoring - Including notification of interested parts in case of any failure. Pieces of software you have to tie up and make them work together.<br><br>But hey, ruby lovers, you may have a better way to get this going! Released by <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" title="TW's web site">ThoughtWorks</a>, <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/rubyworks" title="RubyWorks">RubyWorks</a> is, as quoted from their website, a production application stack for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby On Rails">Ruby On Rails</a> applications. I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.<br><br>First of all I didn't want to mess with my actual configuration so I installed a new vm with <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" title="Virtual Box">Virtual Box</a>. It has Ubuntu 7.10 on it, with 256MB of memory.<br><br>After installing RubyWorks - instructions on their website -, you get a new skeleton rails app up and running, being served by 4 <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/" title="Mongrel">mongrels</a> that defaults to production environment! Impressed? There is more. A <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/" title="HAProxy">HAProxy</a> is also set up in front of your mongrel servers acting as a load balancer.<br><br>Well, you probably want to monitor all that stuff huh? A <a href="http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/" title="Monit">monit</a> web interface is waiting for your call on port 2812! It monitors all your mongrel servers - four by default - and your HAProxy, allowing you to measure CPU and Memory usage, among other things.<br><br>The coolest thing here is that all these softwares you would have to setup by hand are already working together, ready for production! Well, is it?<br><br>Going a little deeper, I deployed a database backed application to test this stack's performance.<br><br>I used <a href="http://www.joedog.org/JoeDog/Siege" title="Siege">Siege</a> to stress the app and I am very happy with the results! I compared it with a single mongrel running on production env and no proxy at all.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that having 4 mongrels running took my vm to 77% of memory usage, while a single mongrel took it to 38%.<br><br>
