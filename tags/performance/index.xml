      <description>There are several ways you can measure your rails application&#39;s performance. The techniques range from filling your code with &#34;puts&#34; statements - :p - to fancy ones like NewRelic - which is quite nice, I must say.
But what many people don&#39;t know is that rails ships with a handful of scripts to help you out. One of which is called profiler, located under your application&#39;s scripts/performance directory.
By default it uses the standard ruby profiler but if you want more speed - and additional reporting options - , consider installing the ruby-prof gem.</description>
