      <description>It&#39;s been more than a year since I started my new endeavor here in Spain, moving from Brazil and starting a whole new life - both personal and professional. Time for a little retrospective.
More precisely, a retrospective about the agile practices here at the company.
When I first started out back in January &#39;08 the company thought they were agile. NOT! They did adopt some XP practices but just to give you an idea, I&#39;m gonna focus on just one: stand-up meetings.</description>
