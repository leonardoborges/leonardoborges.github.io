      It's been more than a year since I started my new endeavor here in Spain, moving from Brazil and starting a whole new life - both personal and professional. Time for a little retrospective.
More precisely, a retrospective about the agile practices here at the company.
When I first started out back in January '08 the company thought they were agile. NOT! They did adopt some XP practices but just to give you an idea, I'm gonna focus on just one: stand-up meetings.

      I solved a few of the problems on Project Euler in the past, both in Java and Ruby, and thought it would be useful to redo them in Clojure, thus improving my skills on the language&rsquo;s core functions and libraries. Today I&rsquo;ll share problem 4.
Go ahead and read it but here&rsquo;s the meat of it:
&ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.

      I said final classes are evil and that post got some attention with interesting comments. Maybe because of the title and the tone I wrote it, a few comments didn't get my real intention and perhaps I should have been more explicit about it. Go ahead and read it. I'll wait. :)
Anyway, I thought I'd expand a little more on that subject, explaining my motivation to write that post and going through the topics I think were raised by my dear readers.

Every now and then I still do some Java coding. And I actually like it. I spent several years of my career developing primarily in Java and am very keen about the language.
I've been a fierce defender of it these days, specially with the wave of popularity of other languages such as Ruby and Groovy.

The hability to tweak implementations without touching your code is awesome and the DI frameworks, like spring, saves you a lot of coding.

      A year and four months ago I joined Atlassian to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at EuroClojure and this year at QCon Brazil. Even Cognitect wrote a few words about it.
In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many!

The talks had a healthy mix of research and industry case studies with subjects ranging from the technical challenges of current blockchain implementations to the legal implications of distributed ledger technology.

However the reason for which I attended the meetup is that Sean Corfield - a prolific member of the Clojure community - gave a presentation on how he introduced and migrated most of his backend code at World Singles from CFML to Clojure - hence my interest.

  Recently I had some free time to come back to Purely Functional Data Structures and implement a new data structure: Red-black trees.
Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.

YOW! LambdaJam is a conference targeted at intermediate and advanced functional programmers and is organised in talks, jams and workshops.
 Talks are the traditional format and are 30 minutes long; Workshops aim to introduce a specific subjects to attendees in great detail and are up to two hours long; Jams are hands-on sessions.

      Last week while attending Clojure/West in Portland I came across a paper called Why calculating is better than scheming. In a nutshell, this paper is a critique to Abelson and Sussman&lsquo;s classic textbook SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, used by MIT for many years to teach their introductory programming course.
If you haven&rsquo;t read SICP, you should. It&rsquo;s an amazing book. It uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, as the vehicle to present fundamental programming concepts.

  Last year I started reading a book called Purely Functional Data Structures. It&rsquo;s a fascinating book and if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how Clojure&rsquo;s persistent data structures work, it&rsquo;s mandatory reading.
However, all code samples in the book are written in ML - with Haskell versions in the end of the book.

  Monoids Simply put, Monoids describe types containing a binary function and an identity value.
When applied to the identity value and a random value x, said function leaves its argument x untouched, returning it as a result.

Different than most tutorials though I aim to take a different approach. The good news is that I won&rsquo;t be comparing monads to burritos :)
People say one needs to have his/her own epiphany in order to understand Monads and reading explanations from others is of little help. My goal is to disprove that.

Heroku I use Heroku as my deployment platform and my project had been running on it for a few weeks without any issues. I also use Heroku&rsquo;s PostgreSQL solution.
However, by upgrading to Leiningen 2, my project started throwing some weird exceptions during deployment - it couldn&rsquo;t connect to my database any longer.

Go ahead and read it but here&rsquo;s the meat of it:
&ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.

The format was rather simple. First, we had a brief introduction to the language syntax by breaking down a couple of snippets and understanding how each bit worked. For instance, this is one of those snippets:
;;word count (reduce #(if (%1 %2) (assoc %1 %2 (inc (%1 %2))) (assoc %1 %2 1)) {} (clojure.

The problem chosen was the Karate Chop, from Dave Thomas' Code Kata.
As it was also my first time organizing a Dojo, we took some time to get things straight, explain everyone the rules and start coding. Nothing that would compromise the experience, though.
The rules were basically the ones of a RandoriKata and as a mechanism for switching pairs we chose the TimeBox with a limit of 5 minutes.

      I hinted at LambdaJam Australia back in my 2012 Highlights post and the dates are fast approaching so I thought appropriate to blog about it once more.
YOW! LambdaJam is a conference targeted at intermediate and advanced functional programmers and is organised in talks, jams and workshops.
 Talks are the traditional format and are 30 minutes long; Workshops aim to introduce a specific subjects to attendees in great detail and are up to two hours long; Jams are hands-on sessions.

      I was in São Paulo last week - the 3rd and 4th of November - for RubyConf Brazil. For those who don&rsquo;t know, RubyConf Brazil is the evolution of Rails Summit Latin America, where I had the privilege to speak in 2009.
This year though, all bets were off. Fabio Akita and Locaweb put together a great event, with over 700 attendees and about 30 speakers split in two streams and two awesome days.

I met some really cool people, discussed a whole bunch of technical subjects and managed not to get so nervous in my first presentation ever - I'm not counting internal presentations I've done for my team...

Overall I'll be spending 12 days in Brazil, with 2 of them dedicated to the conference. The other 10 I'll be in Rio de Janeiro visiting my family and friends. I strongly advise you to spend some time in Rio too, if at all possible.

Tutorials (Tuesday)
- Meta-programming Ruby for fun and profit (Neal Ford, Patrick Farley)
The old and good techniques that made Ruby so powerful. Here Neal and Patrick walked us through the main tricks to meta programming like open classes - and conditionally open them - , dynamically define methods, sending messages to objects and how Ruby can help test your Java code in a much easier way.

Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.

  Last year I started reading a book called Purely Functional Data Structures. It&rsquo;s a fascinating book and if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how Clojure&rsquo;s persistent data structures work, it&rsquo;s mandatory reading.
However, all code samples in the book are written in ML - with Haskell versions in the end of the book.

  Recently I had some free time to come back to Purely Functional Data Structures and implement a new data structure: Red-black trees.
Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.

YOW! LambdaJam is a conference targeted at intermediate and advanced functional programmers and is organised in talks, jams and workshops.
 Talks are the traditional format and are 30 minutes long; Workshops aim to introduce a specific subjects to attendees in great detail and are up to two hours long; Jams are hands-on sessions.

      Last week while attending Clojure/West in Portland I came across a paper called Why calculating is better than scheming. In a nutshell, this paper is a critique to Abelson and Sussman&lsquo;s classic textbook SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, used by MIT for many years to teach their introductory programming course.
If you haven&rsquo;t read SICP, you should. It&rsquo;s an amazing book. It uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, as the vehicle to present fundamental programming concepts.

  Last year I started reading a book called Purely Functional Data Structures. It&rsquo;s a fascinating book and if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how Clojure&rsquo;s persistent data structures work, it&rsquo;s mandatory reading.
However, all code samples in the book are written in ML - with Haskell versions in the end of the book.

It&rsquo;s a validation library for Clojure apps and it lets you write code like this:
(def person {:name &#34;Leo&#34;}) (validate person :name required :age [required number]) If you&rsquo;d like to see more examples and a detailed guide check out the github repository. The README should get you started.
This post however isn&rsquo;t only about announcing bouncer. It&rsquo;s also about the motivation and implementation details behind it.

      Recently I upgraded the clojure project I&rsquo;m working on to Leiningen 2 in order to start using nrepl - since swank-clojure is now deprecated. Little did I know this would lead me to a small debugging adventure.
Heroku I use Heroku as my deployment platform and my project had been running on it for a few weeks without any issues. I also use Heroku&rsquo;s PostgreSQL solution.
However, by upgrading to Leiningen 2, my project started throwing some weird exceptions during deployment - it couldn&rsquo;t connect to my database any longer.

However the reason for which I attended the meetup is that Sean Corfield - a prolific member of the Clojure community - gave a presentation on how he introduced and migrated most of his backend code at World Singles from CFML to Clojure - hence my interest.

      This will come as no surprise to my closest friends, but I am a long time game development admirer. Although I've never done anything professionally I did spend some time in the past studying this amazingly interesting field - it's my dark hobby. As hardware evolves and gamers demand more and more reality from their consoles, the game development industry is one of the few that basically didn't suffer with the latest economic crisis.

      For those who don't know Git is a version control system developed by Linus Torvalds. It's main difference from other tools like SVN and CVS is the fact that it's distributed.
Recently I gave a workshop about Git here at the company where I walked through the most common cases I usually see when working in a team and thought about posting a summary of the commands used in the workshop.

      This is just another one of those boring weekends where I felt the need to hack on something.
If you follow Google Chrome's blog you're probably aware of this little nifty feature they started to implement in their latest builds: HTML5 voice recognition.
And that's when it struck me: "Hey, what if I use that and tweet with my voice instead of typing?"
The result of this hacking session is LoudParrot, a sample Rails app that shows how to do just that.

Although I've never done anything professionally I did spend some time in the past studying this amazingly interesting field - it's my dark hobby.

- A little bit of context
We, as a vast amount of people out there, have legacy Java code. A lot. In our case this legacy is pretty much crucial to our business. We can't just trash it and start from scratch.

      I've just watched a video from Google IO where Martin Fowler and Rebecca Parsons went through some of the aspects that involves the development of an application for the cloud - focusing on the JVM.
In terms of the Google App Engine, you don't have access to a relational database, thing I found out when I first tried it. Instead you get a Big Table.
Martin put out a good analogy and you can just think of it as a nested hash map.

      Wanna help improve JRuby? Make sure you read this post by Charles Nutter first. There he explains how to run Ruby specs with JRuby.
Start with fixing Ruby specs is a great way to get acquainted with the code. And it&rsquo;s also a important task in order to make sure JRuby is the most complete and compatible ruby implementation out there.
But before you get your hands dirty, it will be a lot easier if you can actually debug JRuby&rsquo;s source while fixing any specs - or bugs/features for that matter.

      As many of you know the new language supported at GAE now is Java, as officially announced on their blog. As a Ruby/Rails developer you might not be interested on it but here is a reason you should be: JRuby.
It was only a matter of time until we saw some people deploying JRuby on Rails apps on GAE, like Ola Bini's mini blog app. Guess that was the first one really, as he was beta testing the service in secret.

Every now and then I still do some Java coding. And I actually like it. I spent several years of my career developing primarily in Java and am very keen about the language.
I've been a fierce defender of it these days, specially with the wave of popularity of other languages such as Ruby and Groovy.

This is a very useful tip I shared a while ago at the office and turned out to be extremely useful.<br><br>If you work with java and use eclipse as an IDE you know that eclipse has something called WTP, which stands for Web Tools Platform. It's a set of tools and API's to aid in the development of web and JEE projects.<br><br>That means that if you have a WTP project in your workspace, you can deploy, run and debug it straight from the IDE. But what happens if your project is not of a WTP nature?<br><br>Back at the office we have a coupe of really old Java project. WTP didn't exist back then but we do use Eclipse as our IDE of choice.<br><br>So, how do we debug a deployed project that we don't actually deploy from the IDE? As long as you have the source, it is quite simple:

      When testing it's pretty common to see the need for mocking a certain object, say, a Data Access Ojbect. This way you don't need to depend on a database and you can focus on the actual logic implemented by the method being tested.
For that you have several alternatives like creating the Mock class by hand or - and this is the more common - use one of the various mocking libraries out there.

Well, I have to agree... You know, I love saving keystrokes and achieving more by writing less. And this is so true with Ruby.
Let me give a really simple example, comparing with java - don't get me wrong... I love java, specially the platform, but it fits well here since I've always been a Java guy.

I never paid too much attention on testing database stuff. While working with java, the closest I got to something <em>workable </em>was using the test case abstractions provided by the Spring framework. It ensures that each test method runs in its own transaction that is rolled back after the test's execution.<br><br>Fair enough. I used the <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html#setUp()">setUp()</a> method on my <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html">TestCase</a> to configure some records so I could work with them, removing all of them in the <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html#tearDown()">tearDown()</a> method. It was quite simple and worked.<br><br>But I always felt something strange with this solution. First of all, I had to add another framework just for that. - Actually I was using spring for dependency injection, but if I wasn't, it wouldn't be a nice option. And another thing that bothered me, is that you cannot guarantee that your database is in a known state.<br><br>After I started to work with Ruby - and Rails - I discovered the <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/26">testing fixtures</a>. It is a really nice way to set up your testing data without having to worry about your database state. - If you don't know what I'm talking about, follow the above link first.<br><br>Then I received a message from a co-worker saying he was having some trouble in using <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/">DBUnit</a> with Hibernate, and asked for some help. I've heard of DBUnit before but never tried it myself. It was a very good opportunity to take a better look into it.<br><br>The basic idea after all is very similar to that of the Rails Fixtures: You have some sort of external file - XML in this case - where you set up the testing data. So the framework takes care of erasing the database, inserting your test data and returning it to its original state.<br><br>So far so good, DBUnit's default Classes works with <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/JdbcBasedDBTestCase.html">JDBC,</a> <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/DataSourceBasedDBTestCase.html">DataSources</a> and <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/JndiBasedDBTestCase.html">JNDIDatasources</a>, but not with Hibernate.  The effort to put them working together is minimal and is documented in their web site.<br><br>I decided to share how this can be done with hibernate and in the end, you would have a test case similar to this one:<br><br>

The hability to tweak implementations without touching your code is awesome and the DI frameworks, like spring, saves you a lot of coding.

E isso nÃ£o Ã© simples.<br><br>Ultimamente, desde o Java 5, tem se trocado o XML pelas <a href="http://http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html" title="Java Annotations">annotations</a>. TÃ¡ bom, fica bonitinho nÃ©? AtÃ© que fica. Em alguns casos, atÃ© mais organizado. O <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/annotations/reference/en/html_single/" title="Hibernate Annotations">Hibernate</a> desde a versÃ£o 3 faz uso das <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/overview/faq/persistence.jsp" title="Java Persistence API">annotaions da JPA</a> como alernativa ao seu XML de configuraÃ§Ã£o. E esse sim Ã© um belo caso de sucesso!<br><br>SÃ£o apenas algumas anotaÃ§Ãµes na classe para mapea-la e pronto, adeus xml! Mas como sempre, as anotaÃ§Ãµes jÃ¡ estÃ£o sendo exageradas por aÃ­. Basta decidir configurar uns 3 frameworks - e provavelmente dois deles sÃ£o descenessÃ¡rios no seu projeto - usando anotaÃ§Ãµes e as suas classes ficarÃ£o uma zona! E muito mais ilegÃ­veis que um arquivo XML!<br><br>As anotaÃ§Ãµes sÃ£o recursos muito poderosos e devem ser usadas de forma consciente. Use as que realmente valem a pena, como as que vou falar agora, que fazem parte da nova release do Spring framework, a <a href="http://www.springframework.org/node/548" title="Spring 2.5 rc1">2.5 RC1</a>.

So I coded up something simple that worked and looked nice and decided to share around. It's the jquery-daterange-picker.

      What's the difference between your application's javascript code and its java/ruby/python/whatever code?
Think about it for a second. Done? Well, the answer is: none!
In today's web applications your javascript code is no different from the rest of your code base but yet we treat it with disregard - and we're all to blame.
We often see developers investing time writing all sorts of automated tests around their code base but fail to do the same for their javascript - and yet they get surprised when their client can't click on a button on their web app that depends on that ajax call that has been manually tested once when the page was first released.

Let's face it. We all write crappy code the 1st time. The difference is in what we do about it afterwards.
We might decide it's good enough and keep moving, or we could (and should!) stop and refactor it!

We, as a vast amount of people out there, have legacy Java code. A lot. In our case this legacy is pretty much crucial to our business. We can't just trash it and start from scratch.

In terms of the Google App Engine, you don't have access to a relational database, thing I found out when I first tried it. Instead you get a Big Table.
Martin put out a good analogy and you can just think of it as a nested hash map.

      Wanna help improve JRuby? Make sure you read this post by Charles Nutter first. There he explains how to run Ruby specs with JRuby.
Start with fixing Ruby specs is a great way to get acquainted with the code. And it&rsquo;s also a important task in order to make sure JRuby is the most complete and compatible ruby implementation out there.
But before you get your hands dirty, it will be a lot easier if you can actually debug JRuby&rsquo;s source while fixing any specs - or bugs/features for that matter.

      The rcov_plugin project is a rails plugin for rcov that adds some useful rake tasks to your application. And since I'm currently working in a JRuby project it made sense to use this plugin.
The thing is, among other stuff, an rcov report from a JRuby project includes some files that shouldn't be there at all, plus you also need to change the way you call rcov as such. Thus, I thought I'd contribute these changes to the plugin and my pull request was approved this morning - just install the latest version and you should be good to go.

It was only a matter of time until we saw some people deploying JRuby on Rails apps on GAE, like Ola Bini's mini blog app. Guess that was the first one really, as he was beta testing the service in secret.

We heavily use the XML capabilities of DB2 and this was a huge problem. Every query would work just fine through the activerecord-jdbc-adapter - part of the JRuby Extras .

      A year and four months ago I joined Atlassian to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at EuroClojure and this year at QCon Brazil. Even Cognitect wrote a few words about it.
In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many!

      In the beginning Nearly 4 years ago I founded the Sydney Clojure User Group. I had been playing with Clojure for a little while and started a small study group to learn more. Initially this group was private and held at the ThoughtWorks office.
After a couple of meetups and conversations I decided to open up the group to the public and then realised we weren&rsquo;t the only ones interested in Clojure and, even more important, interested in meeting like-minded people, share experiences and help each other.

      I should have published this post still in 2015 but as I was on holidays traveling around Australia I didn&rsquo;t really have the time to do it. Better late than never, right? (also Linode - the provider hosting this site - has been under a severe DDoS attack so the site just came back up today)
2015 has been a unusually quiet year in this blog. Thankfully that is because I have been extremely busy in many other areas.

Functional Programming I have been advocating Functional Programming and Clojure for a while now and 2014 has been good to me. It was the first year where I was paid to work almost entirely in functional languages. Most of it was in Scala and a little less in Clojure.

      Thanks, ThoughtWorks After 4 years and 8 months I have made the hard decision to change jobs: Friday, 19th of December, was my last day at ThoughtWorks.
In this time I have made many friends and have grown a lot as a professional. Consulting presents so many new challenges that often times the technical problems you are trying to solve are the easiest part of the whole project. I am thankful for that.

      This past weekend - 19-20th of December - a group of highly motivated individuals gave up their Friday night and their entire Saturday simply to learn how to code in Clojure!
It was the first ever ClojureBridge edition in Sydney and if you haven&rsquo;t heard of it before, its goal is to increase diversity in the Clojure community. It does so by offering free workshops targeted at beginners.
You should totally read Julian Gamble&rsquo;s post about the event for details.

As for this year&rsquo;s highlights, let&rsquo;s get started:
Clojure clj-syd - the Sydney Clojure User Group - continues going strong and this is in great part thanks to the amazing community behind it.

Clojure I started clj-syd - the Sydney Clojure User Group - back in January and it has seen a major uptake. We consistently get an average of 25 people each month and there&rsquo;s no shortage of talks and topics to discuss. It&rsquo;s a great crowd and I&rsquo;m proud to have started it and of being part of it.

To me anyway 2011 was a great year but I won&rsquo;t bore you with the details so I&rsquo;ll just jump straight into a couple of highlights!
The biggest one of course was the project we developed to help the Queensland flood victims back in January - which brings me to the next topic:

      Learning new programming languages is fun. And if it's your 2nd, 3rd...Nth programming language you will eventually look for features you already know and love.
Coming from Ruby - but after having done my fair amount of Java for many years, among other things - I end up looking for features like blocks, open classes and syntax sugar like automatic generation of attribute accessors. These are hard to let go of.

      There are several ways you can measure your rails application's performance. The techniques range from filling your code with "puts" statements - :p - to fancy ones like NewRelic - which is quite nice, I must say.
But what many people don't know is that rails ships with a handful of scripts to help you out. One of which is called profiler, located under your application's scripts/performance directory.
By default it uses the standard ruby profiler but if you want more speed - and additional reporting options - , consider installing the ruby-prof gem.

      This will come as no surprise to my closest friends, but I am a long time game development admirer. Although I've never done anything professionally I did spend some time in the past studying this amazingly interesting field - it's my dark hobby.

      Learning new programming languages is fun. And if it's your 2nd, 3rd...Nth programming language you will eventually look for features you already know and love.
Coming from Ruby - but after having done my fair amount of Java for many years, among other things - I end up looking for features like blocks, open classes and syntax sugar like automatic generation of attribute accessors. These are hard to let go of.

Go ahead and read it but here&rsquo;s the meat of it:
&ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.

It can also be used without Rails. Check out full instructions on the GitHub repository.

      Back in January I announced a small but useful plugin called AppConstants, that basically provides a central place where you can store environment specific constants. And since I started using Rails 3 in the past week, I thought I'd make it Rails 3 compatible.
The code is really simple and - as I expected - the upgrade process was quite straight forward.
I'm not gonna write a guide here on how to upgrade your plugins to Rails 3 - there is plenty about that around the web - but instead, just show the steps I went through to upgrade mine.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      It’s funny how every Rails application I - and possibly you - work on ends up needing some sort of per-environment global constants.
Examples may include the application url - It might be used in account activation emails and thus should be different between the development and production environments.
Or perhaps your application depends on external services that, depending on the environment, are available in different URIs.
There are a couple solutions out there but my needs were simple and straightforward, thus I developed a small rails plugin that is the simplest thing that could possibly work: AppConstants.

I use Monit to monitor the services running on my production server - nginx, mysql, php - and as of the first deploy of this application, it only made sense to also monitor Sphinx.

      As you probably know, since rails 2.1 you can write test methods in the following format:
test "hotel should return its permalink" do
#your test code here
end

Which is great, as the test name becomes much more clear. But you can't simply run this test easily from the command line. You'd have to run something like:
$ ruby your_test_file.rb -n test_hotel_should_return_its_permalink

It annoys me. And it's not practical either to make the test fail just so you can get the test's real name.

      The rcov_plugin project is a rails plugin for rcov that adds some useful rake tasks to your application. And since I'm currently working in a JRuby project it made sense to use this plugin.
The thing is, among other stuff, an rcov report from a JRuby project includes some files that shouldn't be there at all, plus you also need to change the way you call rcov as such. Thus, I thought I'd contribute these changes to the plugin and my pull request was approved this morning - just install the latest version and you should be good to go.

      There are several ways you can measure your rails application's performance. The techniques range from filling your code with "puts" statements - :p - to fancy ones like NewRelic - which is quite nice, I must say.
But what many people don't know is that rails ships with a handful of scripts to help you out. One of which is called profiler, located under your application's scripts/performance directory.
By default it uses the standard ruby profiler but if you want more speed - and additional reporting options - , consider installing the ruby-prof gem.

Yeah, I know it's pretty simple to use, got a nice interface and, again, it's just there. And it is a good library, for most things. But if you, as me, came to a point that processing XML is taking 50% of the time to render a rails action, it's time to change.

- Meta-programming Ruby for fun and profit (Neal Ford, Patrick Farley)
The old and good techniques that made Ruby so powerful. Here Neal and Patrick walked us through the main tricks to meta programming like open classes - and conditionally open them - , dynamically define methods, sending messages to objects and how Ruby can help test your Java code in a much easier way.

      So I couldn't resist and bought myself a MacBook Pro! It's my first week with my new toy and I'm really enjoying it.
But I need to do something useful with it so I started to prepare it to be my new development platform, starting with Ruby/Rails + MySQL: Here is where the fun begins!
After I installed both Rails and MySQL, I fired up a terminal an typed:

       REXML, the XML library uses by many ruby apps, including rails, has a vulnerability that requires an immediate patch on whatever rails version you're using.
Details and instructions on the official rails weblog, here.
But basically, this is what you need to do:
gem install rexml-expansion-fix

Then, require rexml-expansion-fix in your rails's app environment.rb file.

It's by far the biggest Rails event we've ever had, including many of the speakers that were present at RailsConf.
FÃ¡bio Akita is also one of the speakers and provides more details on his blog.
If you're a assumed rails geek don't miss the opportunity to hear from the big names and to know a beautiful country like Brazil.

      This week we started to test mod_rails in a couple of projects where I work on. One in production.
Of course it's too early for any conclusions, but I just wanted to share a couple of problems you might find when the installer tries to compile the Apache module.
In our case, and I believe it is the case of many servers out there, we have a custom Apache installation, what makes the installer not find it and/or not find the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) sometimes.

I arrived last week in Madrid and the past 2 weeks before that I spent basically packing my stuff. There is still some paperwork going on but everything is flowing well.
Besides this little feedback, I was reading this week's issue of the excellent series This Week In Ruby, from my friend Antonio Cangiano.

The idea is to ease the pain on rails applications deployment. I tested myself and in less than five minutes I had my application working behind Apache!
I'm not going to say much here besides the fact that it seems like a really good option for rails deployment and people have been talking about it already, including DHH.
But I do recommend a read on the architecture overview document.

      Update: Follow up link to this issue on JRuby's Jira, here
As I told in my last post, it was time to give JRuby a serious try. So I took one of our rails projects at work and decided to migrate it to JRuby and see what happens.
We heavily use the XML capabilities of DB2 and this was a huge problem. Every query would work just fine through the activerecord-jdbc-adapter - part of the JRuby Extras .

Almost 300 attendees already registered for the event. And a few very interesting people will be speaking there like Matz and DHH (this one, through skype).
Besides that, the organization staff is scheduling 2 parties, friday and saturday, for the attendees.

In my new job we work with XML data natively stored on DB2. I have done some test with Rails and DB2 a few weeks ago and it's pretty interesting, specially the easiness that Rails deals with XML.

Well, we all know how hard, or at least cumbersome, it can be to set up a production environment to deploy your applications. Besides all the hardware stuff like storages, links, routers you are still left with a huge amount of software configuration to handle. This often includes configuring things like clusters, load balancing and services monitoring - Including notification of interested parts in case of any failure. Pieces of software you have to tie up and make them work together.<br><br>But hey, ruby lovers, you may have a better way to get this going! Released by <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" title="TW's web site">ThoughtWorks</a>, <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/rubyworks" title="RubyWorks">RubyWorks</a> is, as quoted from their website, a production application stack for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby On Rails">Ruby On Rails</a> applications. I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.<br><br>First of all I didn't want to mess with my actual configuration so I installed a new vm with <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" title="Virtual Box">Virtual Box</a>. It has Ubuntu 7.10 on it, with 256MB of memory.<br><br>After installing RubyWorks - instructions on their website -, you get a new skeleton rails app up and running, being served by 4 <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/" title="Mongrel">mongrels</a> that defaults to production environment! Impressed? There is more. A <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/" title="HAProxy">HAProxy</a> is also set up in front of your mongrel servers acting as a load balancer.<br><br>Well, you probably want to monitor all that stuff huh? A <a href="http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/" title="Monit">monit</a> web interface is waiting for your call on port 2812! It monitors all your mongrel servers - four by default - and your HAProxy, allowing you to measure CPU and Memory usage, among other things.<br><br>The coolest thing here is that all these softwares you would have to setup by hand are already working together, ready for production! Well, is it?<br><br>Going a little deeper, I deployed a database backed application to test this stack's performance.<br><br>I used <a href="http://www.joedog.org/JoeDog/Siege" title="Siege">Siege</a> to stress the app and I am very happy with the results! I compared it with a single mongrel running on production env and no proxy at all.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that having 4 mongrels running took my vm to 77% of memory usage, while a single mongrel took it to 38%.<br><br>

- Meta-programming Ruby for fun and profit (Neal Ford, Patrick Farley)
The old and good techniques that made Ruby so powerful. Here Neal and Patrick walked us through the main tricks to meta programming like open classes - and conditionally open them - , dynamically define methods, sending messages to objects and how Ruby can help test your Java code in a much easier way.

Let's face it. We all write crappy code the 1st time. The difference is in what we do about it afterwards.
We might decide it's good enough and keep moving, or we could (and should!) stop and refactor it!

TextMate is the one I've used the most and it's been ok for a long time. Until you realize you need half a dozen bundles to make it really useful for ruby development. Obviously the same goes for Vim and gedit.

      This is just a quick post to let you know that AppConstants can now be used as gem!
Just add it to your Gemfile and 'bundle install' it:
#in your Gemfile gem &quot;app_constants&quot; #in the console $ bundle install $ rails generate app_constants #then follow the instructions on-screen instructions 
It can also be used without Rails. Check out full instructions on the GitHub repository.
Feedback welcome :)

      I think by now everyone's heard of the hard time the guys up in Queensland, Australia are having because of the recent floods. People have lost their lives and many others have lost their homes and businesses, product of years of hard work.
As a result of this massive disaster the Queensland Government decided to run a telethon to encourage donations to help the flood victims. The Telethon aired last Sunday, 09/01/11, on Channel 9 and lasted for 2 hours.

      Back in January I announced a small but useful plugin called AppConstants, that basically provides a central place where you can store environment specific constants. And since I started using Rails 3 in the past week, I thought I'd make it Rails 3 compatible.
The code is really simple and - as I expected - the upgrade process was quite straight forward.
I'm not gonna write a guide here on how to upgrade your plugins to Rails 3 - there is plenty about that around the web - but instead, just show the steps I went through to upgrade mine.

      Learning new programming languages is fun. And if it's your 2nd, 3rd...Nth programming language you will eventually look for features you already know and love.
Coming from Ruby - but after having done my fair amount of Java for many years, among other things - I end up looking for features like blocks, open classes and syntax sugar like automatic generation of attribute accessors. These are hard to let go of.

      What?
In Ruby you have basically two ways of defining private methods:

I see a small problem with both approaches. In the first one, and the most obvious, is that you need to duplicate the method name as well as add an extra method call - private - just to change its visibility.
The second approach avoids this but adds the risk of accidentally putting a method that is intended to be public under the private section of the source file, which can render an annoying debugging session.

Let's face it. We all write crappy code the 1st time. The difference is in what we do about it afterwards.
We might decide it's good enough and keep moving, or we could (and should!) stop and refactor it!

Start with fixing Ruby specs is a great way to get acquainted with the code. And it&rsquo;s also a important task in order to make sure JRuby is the most complete and compatible ruby implementation out there.
But before you get your hands dirty, it will be a lot easier if you can actually debug JRuby&rsquo;s source while fixing any specs - or bugs/features for that matter.

      As you probably know, since rails 2.1 you can write test methods in the following format:
test "hotel should return its permalink" do
#your test code here
end

Which is great, as the test name becomes much more clear. But you can't simply run this test easily from the command line. You'd have to run something like:
$ ruby your_test_file.rb -n test_hotel_should_return_its_permalink

It annoys me. And it's not practical either to make the test fail just so you can get the test's real name.

      There are several ways you can measure your rails application's performance. The techniques range from filling your code with "puts" statements - :p - to fancy ones like NewRelic - which is quite nice, I must say.
But what many people don't know is that rails ships with a handful of scripts to help you out. One of which is called profiler, located under your application's scripts/performance directory.
By default it uses the standard ruby profiler but if you want more speed - and additional reporting options - , consider installing the ruby-prof gem.

No problem! Override it with your new code, call super and.... Uh oh!! Suddenly this turned into a problem... Let me give some more context.
I was testing Ferret (and the acts_as_ferret plugin) in a project to provide full text search capabilities to our models. One of the things the plugin does is to add a new method to ActiveRecord, called find_with_ferret.

      Behold latin american railers!
This year we will have the Rails Summit Latin America on October, 15th and 16th, in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.
It's by far the biggest Rails event we've ever had, including many of the speakers that were present at RailsConf.
FÃ¡bio Akita is also one of the speakers and provides more details on his blog.
If you're a assumed rails geek don't miss the opportunity to hear from the big names and to know a beautiful country like Brazil.

      This week we started to test mod_rails in a couple of projects where I work on. One in production.
Of course it's too early for any conclusions, but I just wanted to share a couple of problems you might find when the installer tries to compile the Apache module.
In our case, and I believe it is the case of many servers out there, we have a custom Apache installation, what makes the installer not find it and/or not find the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) sometimes.

I arrived last week in Madrid and the past 2 weeks before that I spent basically packing my stuff. There is still some paperwork going on but everything is flowing well.

The idea is to ease the pain on rails applications deployment. I tested myself and in less than five minutes I had my application working behind Apache!
I'm not going to say much here besides the fact that it seems like a really good option for rails deployment and people have been talking about it already, including DHH.
But I do recommend a read on the architecture overview document.

      Update: Follow up link to this issue on JRuby's Jira, here
As I told in my last post, it was time to give JRuby a serious try. So I took one of our rails projects at work and decided to migrate it to JRuby and see what happens.
We heavily use the XML capabilities of DB2 and this was a huge problem. Every query would work just fine through the activerecord-jdbc-adapter - part of the JRuby Extras .

Well, I have to agree... You know, I love saving keystrokes and achieving more by writing less. And this is so true with Ruby.
Let me give a really simple example, comparing with java - don't get me wrong... I love java, specially the platform, but it fits well here since I've always been a Java guy.

I'll try to put here toghether my impressions and some notes I took while I was there.
Marting Fowler started discussing what DSL's are and giving some examples that many of us use in our day to day Job.

Well, we all know how hard, or at least cumbersome, it can be to set up a production environment to deploy your applications. Besides all the hardware stuff like storages, links, routers you are still left with a huge amount of software configuration to handle. This often includes configuring things like clusters, load balancing and services monitoring - Including notification of interested parts in case of any failure. Pieces of software you have to tie up and make them work together.<br><br>But hey, ruby lovers, you may have a better way to get this going! Released by <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com/" title="TW's web site">ThoughtWorks</a>, <a href="http://studios.thoughtworks.com/rubyworks" title="RubyWorks">RubyWorks</a> is, as quoted from their website, a production application stack for <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby On Rails">Ruby On Rails</a> applications. I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.<br><br>First of all I didn't want to mess with my actual configuration so I installed a new vm with <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" title="Virtual Box">Virtual Box</a>. It has Ubuntu 7.10 on it, with 256MB of memory.<br><br>After installing RubyWorks - instructions on their website -, you get a new skeleton rails app up and running, being served by 4 <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/" title="Mongrel">mongrels</a> that defaults to production environment! Impressed? There is more. A <a href="http://haproxy.1wt.eu/" title="HAProxy">HAProxy</a> is also set up in front of your mongrel servers acting as a load balancer.<br><br>Well, you probably want to monitor all that stuff huh? A <a href="http://www.tildeslash.com/monit/" title="Monit">monit</a> web interface is waiting for your call on port 2812! It monitors all your mongrel servers - four by default - and your HAProxy, allowing you to measure CPU and Memory usage, among other things.<br><br>The coolest thing here is that all these softwares you would have to setup by hand are already working together, ready for production! Well, is it?<br><br>Going a little deeper, I deployed a database backed application to test this stack's performance.<br><br>I used <a href="http://www.joedog.org/JoeDog/Siege" title="Siege">Siege</a> to stress the app and I am very happy with the results! I compared it with a single mongrel running on production env and no proxy at all.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that having 4 mongrels running took my vm to 77% of memory usage, while a single mongrel took it to 38%.<br><br>

Isso Ã© um fato. Cada linha de XML que eu escrevo me faz pensar em formas de evita-las. E isso nÃ£o Ã© simples.<br><br>Ultimamente, desde o Java 5, tem se trocado o XML pelas <a href="http://http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html" title="Java Annotations">annotations</a>. TÃ¡ bom, fica bonitinho nÃ©? AtÃ© que fica. Em alguns casos, atÃ© mais organizado. O <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/annotations/reference/en/html_single/" title="Hibernate Annotations">Hibernate</a> desde a versÃ£o 3 faz uso das <a href="http://java.sun.com/javaee/overview/faq/persistence.jsp" title="Java Persistence API">annotaions da JPA</a> como alernativa ao seu XML de configuraÃ§Ã£o. E esse sim Ã© um belo caso de sucesso!<br><br>SÃ£o apenas algumas anotaÃ§Ãµes na classe para mapea-la e pronto, adeus xml! Mas como sempre, as anotaÃ§Ãµes jÃ¡ estÃ£o sendo exageradas por aÃ­. Basta decidir configurar uns 3 frameworks - e provavelmente dois deles sÃ£o descenessÃ¡rios no seu projeto - usando anotaÃ§Ãµes e as suas classes ficarÃ£o uma zona! E muito mais ilegÃ­veis que um arquivo XML!<br><br>As anotaÃ§Ãµes sÃ£o recursos muito poderosos e devem ser usadas de forma consciente. Use as que realmente valem a pena, como as que vou falar agora, que fazem parte da nova release do Spring framework, a <a href="http://www.springframework.org/node/548" title="Spring 2.5 rc1">2.5 RC1</a>.

      What's the difference between your application's javascript code and its java/ruby/python/whatever code?
Think about it for a second. Done? Well, the answer is: none!
In today's web applications your javascript code is no different from the rest of your code base but yet we treat it with disregard - and we're all to blame.
We often see developers investing time writing all sorts of automated tests around their code base but fail to do the same for their javascript - and yet they get surprised when their client can't click on a button on their web app that depends on that ajax call that has been manually tested once when the page was first released.

      The rcov_plugin project is a rails plugin for rcov that adds some useful rake tasks to your application. And since I'm currently working in a JRuby project it made sense to use this plugin.
The thing is, among other stuff, an rcov report from a JRuby project includes some files that shouldn't be there at all, plus you also need to change the way you call rcov as such. Thus, I thought I'd contribute these changes to the plugin and my pull request was approved this morning - just install the latest version and you should be good to go.

      When testing it's pretty common to see the need for mocking a certain object, say, a Data Access Ojbect. This way you don't need to depend on a database and you can focus on the actual logic implemented by the method being tested.
For that you have several alternatives like creating the Mock class by hand or - and this is the more common - use one of the various mocking libraries out there.

I never paid too much attention on testing database stuff. While working with java, the closest I got to something <em>workable </em>was using the test case abstractions provided by the Spring framework. It ensures that each test method runs in its own transaction that is rolled back after the test's execution.<br><br>Fair enough. I used the <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html#setUp()">setUp()</a> method on my <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html">TestCase</a> to configure some records so I could work with them, removing all of them in the <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/junit/framework/TestCase.html#tearDown()">tearDown()</a> method. It was quite simple and worked.<br><br>But I always felt something strange with this solution. First of all, I had to add another framework just for that. - Actually I was using spring for dependency injection, but if I wasn't, it wouldn't be a nice option. And another thing that bothered me, is that you cannot guarantee that your database is in a known state.<br><br>After I started to work with Ruby - and Rails - I discovered the <a href="http://manuals.rubyonrails.com/read/chapter/26">testing fixtures</a>. It is a really nice way to set up your testing data without having to worry about your database state. - If you don't know what I'm talking about, follow the above link first.<br><br>Then I received a message from a co-worker saying he was having some trouble in using <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/">DBUnit</a> with Hibernate, and asked for some help. I've heard of DBUnit before but never tried it myself. It was a very good opportunity to take a better look into it.<br><br>The basic idea after all is very similar to that of the Rails Fixtures: You have some sort of external file - XML in this case - where you set up the testing data. So the framework takes care of erasing the database, inserting your test data and returning it to its original state.<br><br>So far so good, DBUnit's default Classes works with <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/JdbcBasedDBTestCase.html">JDBC,</a> <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/DataSourceBasedDBTestCase.html">DataSources</a> and <a href="http://www.dbunit.org/apidocs/org/dbunit/JndiBasedDBTestCase.html">JNDIDatasources</a>, but not with Hibernate.  The effort to put them working together is minimal and is documented in their web site.<br><br>I decided to share how this can be done with hibernate and in the end, you would have a test case similar to this one:<br><br>

The format was rather simple. First, we had a brief introduction to the language syntax by breaking down a couple of snippets and understanding how each bit worked. For instance, this is one of those snippets:
;;word count (reduce #(if (%1 %2) (assoc %1 %2 (inc (%1 %2))) (assoc %1 %2 1)) {} (clojure.

The first thing you notice when joining ThoughtWorks is that you're surrounded by smart, opinionated people. It was once common for me to be the one fighting for automated testing, TDD, Ruby and overall finding new and better ways of doing what we do - but imagine how different it is to join a team that takes that for granted.

      So you found yourself in the need to override a method but still count on it's old behaviour?
No problem! Override it with your new code, call super and.... Uh oh!! Suddenly this turned into a problem... Let me give some more context.
I was testing Ferret (and the acts_as_ferret plugin) in a project to provide full text search capabilities to our models. One of the things the plugin does is to add a new method to ActiveRecord, called find_with_ferret.

Rails Summit finished a few days ago and I have only one word to describe it: Awesome!
I met some really cool people, discussed a whole bunch of technical subjects and managed not to get so nervous in my first presentation ever - I'm not counting internal presentations I've done for my team...
My slides and source files can be found here. Feel free to contact me with questions if you got any.

      Once more my life is taking a huge turn.
I've been pretty quiet for the past month and honestly don't know how I managed to hold in my excitement. I've just accepted an offer from ThoughtWorks to be based at their australian offices, either in Sydney or Melbourne, depending on where my 1st project will be.
For those of you who don't know, ThoughtWorks is a global IT consultancy that is really well known in the software development community.

      So here I am! Alive and kicking!!!
Just got back from vacation. Brazil was awesome and so was xmas in Norway! Lots of food in both places! Need a diet! :p Warming up for new year's now.
But the reason for this post is the last comment on my Rails 2.0 scaffold post, quoted here:
Hi Leonardo,
I am extremely grateful for your info altruism. I thought maybe I could show my gratitude with a small donation but I donâ€™t see anywhere on your site to do so.

The reason? Next friday I'm going to Brazil for vacation and right after, in the end of december, I'm going to extend my trip a bit and spend xmas in Norway.
Just hope to come back alive from Brazil! My friends are promising a real blast!!!!! :D

      Besides the fact that I am a software developer, I do eat. I even enjoy doing so. Specially when I'm traveling.
That's why i decided to put up a new weblog only for this kind of stuff - it's called Travel tips - food & stuff. Basically for friends and whoever else might be interested.
There I plan to share some nice restaurants I've been to. At least to start with.

I arrived last week in Madrid and the past 2 weeks before that I spent basically packing my stuff. There is still some paperwork going on but everything is flowing well.
Besides this little feedback, I was reading this week's issue of the excellent series This Week In Ruby, from my friend Antonio Cangiano.
