      I solved a few of the problems on Project Euler in the past, both in Java and Ruby, and thought it would be useful to redo them in Clojure, thus improving my skills on the language&rsquo;s core functions and libraries. Today I&rsquo;ll share problem 4.
Go ahead and read it but here&rsquo;s the meat of it:
&ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.

      Last week our current client - ninemsn - ran the 3rd edition of their HackDay.
It&rsquo;s akin to Atlassian&rsquo;s ShipIt days so if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept, you should check their page but here&rsquo;s the gist:
  We&rsquo;re given 24 hours to work on whatever we like as long as it&rsquo;s related somehow to the business
  We&rsquo;re also free to use any technology we want

      A year and four months ago I joined Atlassian to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at EuroClojure and this year at QCon Brazil. Even Cognitect wrote a few words about it.
In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many!

      Early last week I had the chance to attend the Symposium on Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology organised by UNSW. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that UNSW was so heavily involved in the community until this event and have since learned about their interest group which has been going on for a while.
The talks had a healthy mix of research and industry case studies with subjects ranging from the technical challenges of current blockchain implementations to the legal implications of distributed ledger technology.

Morning Panel Day 2 started with a morning panel with:
 Paul Fox from Blockchain.capital Leon Gerard Vandenberg from RightsFusion Pty Ltd &amp; Solara Oliver Harvey from ASIC Ross Buckley from UNSW Law  The panelists took turns in giving their views around blockchain, investments and regulation, leading into a Q&amp;A at the end. I was running late to this session and believe I may have missed Ross&rsquo; individual slot.

However the reason for which I attended the meetup is that Sean Corfield - a prolific member of the Clojure community - gave a presentation on how he introduced and migrated most of his backend code at World Singles from CFML to Clojure - hence my interest.

 Running Clojure apps on Heroku - Lincoln Stoll (@lstoll)  Linc works for Heroku but ended up not spending a whole lot of time talking about that - instead he showed us how to build a simple web application using Compojure, a small Clojure web framework.

      A year and four months ago I joined Atlassian to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at EuroClojure and this year at QCon Brazil. Even Cognitect wrote a few words about it.
In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many!

Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.

      Long gone are the days when systems needed to do only one thing at a time.
Concurrency is the word but it often leads to complex code, dealing with locks, mutexes etc…
There are several different abstractions which allows us to both model and think about asynchronous code in a more sane fashion: futures, promises and events/callbacks are but a few of them.
I won&rsquo;t get into the merits - or lack thereof - of these alternatives in this post but rather focus on a different alternative: Communicating Sequential Processes - CSP.

In a nutshell, this paper is a critique to Abelson and Sussman&lsquo;s classic textbook SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, used by MIT for many years to teach their introductory programming course.
If you haven&rsquo;t read SICP, you should. It&rsquo;s an amazing book. It uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, as the vehicle to present fundamental programming concepts.

However, all code samples in the book are written in ML - with Haskell versions in the end of the book.

  Monoids Simply put, Monoids describe types containing a binary function and an identity value.
When applied to the identity value and a random value x, said function leaves its argument x untouched, returning it as a result.

      This is Part II of my Monads tutorial. Make sure you read the previous parts:
  Part I - Functors
  Part II - Applicative Functors (this post)
  Part III - Monoids
  Part IV - Monads
  Applicative Functors In Part I I talked a little about Haskell type signatures and introduced Functors, which provide a way to map standard functions over values which are wrapped inside a Functor - we used fmap for that.

      Today I join the already bloated group of people who wrote monad tutorials. It&rsquo;s a bit of a ritual, really.
Different than most tutorials though I aim to take a different approach. The good news is that I won&rsquo;t be comparing monads to burritos :)
People say one needs to have his/her own epiphany in order to understand Monads and reading explanations from others is of little help. My goal is to disprove that.

      Recently I upgraded the clojure project I&rsquo;m working on to Leiningen 2 in order to start using nrepl - since swank-clojure is now deprecated. Little did I know this would lead me to a small debugging adventure.
Heroku I use Heroku as my deployment platform and my project had been running on it for a few weeks without any issues. I also use Heroku&rsquo;s PostgreSQL solution.
However, by upgrading to Leiningen 2, my project started throwing some weird exceptions during deployment - it couldn&rsquo;t connect to my database any longer.

However the reason for which I attended the meetup is that Sean Corfield - a prolific member of the Clojure community - gave a presentation on how he introduced and migrated most of his backend code at World Singles from CFML to Clojure - hence my interest.

 Running Clojure apps on Heroku - Lincoln Stoll (@lstoll)  Linc works for Heroku but ended up not spending a whole lot of time talking about that - instead he showed us how to build a simple web application using Compojure, a small Clojure web framework.

Go ahead and read it but here&rsquo;s the meat of it:
&ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.

      Long gone are the days when systems needed to do only one thing at a time.
Concurrency is the word but it often leads to complex code, dealing with locks, mutexes etc…
There are several different abstractions which allows us to both model and think about asynchronous code in a more sane fashion: futures, promises and events/callbacks are but a few of them.
I won&rsquo;t get into the merits - or lack thereof - of these alternatives in this post but rather focus on a different alternative: Communicating Sequential Processes - CSP.

      So I had just finished writing this feature. I was confident it&rsquo;d work - after all I had a good level of tests around it. It sounded like yet another successful deployment.
One week in and something starts breaking. It was hard to track down but at the end I realised it was caused by having concurrent processes running in parallel.
That&rsquo;s what happened in a recent production release at our current client.

Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.

      This post is part of a series about Chris Okasaki&rsquo;s Purely Functional Data Structures. You can see all posts in the series by visiting the functional-data-structures category in this blog.
  Recently I had some free time to come back to Purely Functional Data Structures and implement a new data structure: Red-black trees.
Red-black trees Red-black trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. Back when I first learned the balancing algorithm used in operations such as insert and delete, I remember it being a particularly tricky one.

YOW! LambdaJam is a conference targeted at intermediate and advanced functional programmers and is organised in talks, jams and workshops.
 Talks are the traditional format and are 30 minutes long; Workshops aim to introduce a specific subjects to attendees in great detail and are up to two hours long; Jams are hands-on sessions.

      Last week while attending Clojure/West in Portland I came across a paper called Why calculating is better than scheming. In a nutshell, this paper is a critique to Abelson and Sussman&lsquo;s classic textbook SICP - Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, used by MIT for many years to teach their introductory programming course.
If you haven&rsquo;t read SICP, you should. It&rsquo;s an amazing book. It uses Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, as the vehicle to present fundamental programming concepts.

  Last year I started reading a book called Purely Functional Data Structures. It&rsquo;s a fascinating book and if you&rsquo;ve ever wondered how Clojure&rsquo;s persistent data structures work, it&rsquo;s mandatory reading.
However, all code samples in the book are written in ML - with Haskell versions in the end of the book.

This post however isn&rsquo;t only about announcing bouncer. It&rsquo;s also about the motivation and implementation details behind it.

      Recently I upgraded the clojure project I&rsquo;m working on to Leiningen 2 in order to start using nrepl - since swank-clojure is now deprecated. Little did I know this would lead me to a small debugging adventure.
Heroku I use Heroku as my deployment platform and my project had been running on it for a few weeks without any issues. I also use Heroku&rsquo;s PostgreSQL solution.
However, by upgrading to Leiningen 2, my project started throwing some weird exceptions during deployment - it couldn&rsquo;t connect to my database any longer.

However the reason for which I attended the meetup is that Sean Corfield - a prolific member of the Clojure community - gave a presentation on how he introduced and migrated most of his backend code at World Singles from CFML to Clojure - hence my interest.

 After coming back from my holidays in China - which were awesome - I had no downtime at ThoughtWorks and started at a brand new client/project - a much needed change from what I had been working on lately.
It&rsquo;s an iOS project, more specifically an iPad app and that&rsquo;s pretty much all I can tell you about it.

      A year and four months ago I joined Atlassian to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at EuroClojure and this year at QCon Brazil. Even Cognitect wrote a few words about it.
In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many!

      In the beginning Nearly 4 years ago I founded the Sydney Clojure User Group. I had been playing with Clojure for a little while and started a small study group to learn more. Initially this group was private and held at the ThoughtWorks office.
After a couple of meetups and conversations I decided to open up the group to the public and then realised we weren&rsquo;t the only ones interested in Clojure and, even more important, interested in meeting like-minded people, share experiences and help each other.

(also Linode - the provider hosting this site - has been under a severe DDoS attack so the site just came back up today)
2015 has been a unusually quiet year in this blog. Thankfully that is because I have been extremely busy in many other areas.

Functional Programming I have been advocating Functional Programming and Clojure for a while now and 2014 has been good to me. It was the first year where I was paid to work almost entirely in functional languages. Most of it was in Scala and a little less in Clojure.

      Thanks, ThoughtWorks After 4 years and 8 months I have made the hard decision to change jobs: Friday, 19th of December, was my last day at ThoughtWorks.
In this time I have made many friends and have grown a lot as a professional. Consulting presents so many new challenges that often times the technical problems you are trying to solve are the easiest part of the whole project. I am thankful for that.

      This past weekend - 19-20th of December - a group of highly motivated individuals gave up their Friday night and their entire Saturday simply to learn how to code in Clojure!
It was the first ever ClojureBridge edition in Sydney and if you haven&rsquo;t heard of it before, its goal is to increase diversity in the Clojure community. It does so by offering free workshops targeted at beginners.
You should totally read Julian Gamble&rsquo;s post about the event for details.

As for this year&rsquo;s highlights, let&rsquo;s get started:
Clojure clj-syd - the Sydney Clojure User Group - continues going strong and this is in great part thanks to the amazing community behind it.

Clojure I started clj-syd - the Sydney Clojure User Group - back in January and it has seen a major uptake. We consistently get an average of 25 people each month and there&rsquo;s no shortage of talks and topics to discuss. It&rsquo;s a great crowd and I&rsquo;m proud to have started it and of being part of it.

To me anyway 2011 was a great year but I won&rsquo;t bore you with the details so I&rsquo;ll just jump straight into a couple of highlights!
The biggest one of course was the project we developed to help the Queensland flood victims back in January - which brings me to the next topic:

      I solved a few of the problems on Project Euler in the past, both in Java and Ruby, and thought it would be useful to redo them in Clojure, thus improving my skills on the language&rsquo;s core functions and libraries. Today I&rsquo;ll share problem 4.
Go ahead and read it but here&rsquo;s the meat of it:
&ldquo;Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.&quot;
From this statement we can tell two things: (1) we&rsquo;ll need a function that can tell whether a number is a palindrome or not and (2) that the largest palindrome is given by the product of two numbers between 100 and 999, inclusive.
