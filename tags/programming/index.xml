      <description>This will come as no surprise to my closest friends, but I am a long time game development admirer. Although I&#39;ve never done anything professionally I did spend some time in the past studying this amazingly interesting field - it&#39;s my dark hobby. As hardware evolves and gamers demand more and more reality from their consoles, the game development industry is one of the few that basically didn&#39;t suffer with the latest economic crisis.</description>

      <description>Learning new programming languages is fun. And if it&#39;s your 2nd, 3rd...Nth programming language you will eventually look for features you already know and love.
Coming from Ruby - but after having done my fair amount of Java for many years, among other things - I end up looking for features like blocks, open classes and syntax sugar like automatic generation of attribute accessors. These are hard to let go of.</description>

      <description>This is basically a compilation of a few tools/habits that I use to keep focused and at a high level of productivity when working alone. Works great for me and I hope there are useful tips for you as well.
 Music This is one of my favorites. When working alone I hate having noisy people around, which happens quite often if you work in an open office space like me.</description>

      <title>why every programmer have to be dumb</title>

      <description>At least, dumb for the companies hiring them. The old dream is still for sale out there: Build a &#34;I do everything framework&#34; and hire a bunch of dumb programmers - monkeys? - and you shall make money easily!
Just put some button pressers and a full featured enterprise system will be waiting on the other side of this &#34;machine&#34;!
C&#39;mon, I thought this dream was over! We&#39;ve had enough proofs that this doesn&#39;t work!</description>
