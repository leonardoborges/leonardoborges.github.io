      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m extremely happy to let everyone know my book, Clojure Reactive Programming, has finally been published!
You can get it at the publisher&amp;rsquo;s website or on Amazon. I had a great time writing it and I truly hope you find it useful!
I&amp;rsquo;ve met a few authors here and there and I heard more than once that a book is never really finished. I now know what they mean.
The book doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover everything I wanted to write about due to time and space limitations.</description>

      <description>A bit late for a EuroClojure 2014 post but I suppose &amp;ldquo;better late than never&amp;rdquo; applies here.
The best part of every conference is the networking. Meeting new and interesting people is priceless and I did plenty of that - mostly over Polish beer and food. Polish beer isn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest but if you must have it, better stick to Żywiec. It&amp;rsquo;s widely available and was the one which didn&amp;rsquo;t give me a headache :) - I&amp;rsquo;ve been told there are amazing microbreweries though I didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance to try any while in Krákow.</description>
